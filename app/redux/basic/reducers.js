Note that todos also accepts stateâ€”but it's an array! Now todoApp just gives it the slice of the state to manage, and todos knows how to update just that slice. 
This is called reducer composition, and it's the fundamental pattern of building Redux apps.
Note that each of these reducers is managing its own part of the global state. 
The state parameter is different for every reducer, and corresponds to the part of the state it manages.
When you want to split your data handling logic, you'll use reducer composition instead of many stores.
